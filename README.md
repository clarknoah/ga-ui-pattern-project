# Marvel API Accessor
This project highlighted the ability to create a hamburger menu sidebar, and utilizing the Marvel API.


# Hamburger Menu Interface
The Hamburger interface operates using Javascript and CSS. I'm using a flex column container, and have the aside serve as a child element within the container, hidden away upon load.

# Marvel API
The API I used for this project was the Marvel API. It was a bit trickier than I expected to use, and required me to find an open source md5 function that could run in Javascript.

The API required the public, private, and timestamp hashed in a specific order, so that was a bit tricky.


# How to Use
Open index.html file, open the side menu by clicking on the hamburger menu. This will open up the side bar, and you can click on an individual character in order to have their bio show up in the main div.
